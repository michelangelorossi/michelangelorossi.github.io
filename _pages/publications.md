  * Previously titled: How Does Competition Affect Reputation Concerns? Theory and Evidence from Airbnb
  * Abstract: I study how competition affects the role of reputation in encouraging sellers to exert effort. First, I model the reputation building process in a frictional marketplace. With higher competition, sellers exert less effort since their share of transactions’ surplus is lower. Then, I test this prediction by exploiting the introduction of a rental regulation on Airbnb. More competition significantly depresses ratings about effort. Moreover, I compare how competition affects different rating categories to identify the impact on effort. When the number of competitors increases by 10 percent, hosts' effort reduces from the 80th to the 20th percentile of the distribution.
