  * Previously titled: How Does Competition Affect Reputation Concerns? Theory and Evidence from Airbnb
  * Abstract: I study how competition affects the role of reputation to induce sellers to exert effort. First, I model the reputation building process by sellers in a frictional marketplace. With more competition, sellers exert less effort since their share of transactions' surplus is lower. Then, I test this prediction by exploiting a regulation on Airbnb. More competition significantly depresses ratings about hosts' effort. To address Airbnb rating inflation, I estimate hosts' effort comparing ratings' categories reported by the same guests. When the number of competitors increases by 10 percent, effort reduces from the 80th to the 20th percentile of the distribution.
