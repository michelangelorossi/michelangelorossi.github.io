  * Previously titled: How Does Competition Affect Reputation Concerns? Theory and Evidence from Airbnb
  * Abstract: I study how competition affects the role of reputation in encouraging sellers to exert effort. First, I model the reputation-building process in a frictional marketplace. Here, the relative number of buyers and sellers affects how the two sides of the market share the surplus from a match. With more competitors, sellers exert less effort since their share of transactions' surplus is lower. Then, I test this prediction by exploiting the introduction of a rental regulation on Airbnb. More competition significantly depresses ratings about effort. To address rating inflation and selection of guests, I provide an estimation of hosts' effort exploiting the relationship between different categories of ratings reported by the same guests. The negative impact of a 10 percent increase in the number of competitors is equivalent to the variation from the 80th to the 20th percentile of the estimated effort distribution.

  * Abstract: This paper studies the impact of quality disclosures on buyers' ratings using data from an online recommender system. Disclosures may alter expectations on sellers' quality and affect buyers' rating behavior. In particular, if buyers' utility depends on their expectations, a positive disclosure of quality such as an award may lead to buyers' disappointment with a negative influence on their ratings. I identify the disappointment effect in moviegoers' ratings originated from the rise in expectations due to movies' nominations for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards. I control for the selection of moviegoers who watch and rate movies before or after nominations with a non-parametric matching technique. After nominations, ratings for nominated movies significantly drop relative to ratings for movies that were not nominated. Disappointment reduces the rating premium of nominated movies by more than five percent in the next thirty days after the nomination.
