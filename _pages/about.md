Associate Professor of Marketing (without tenure) at HEC Paris. CESifo Research Network Affiliate.

I work at the intersection of industrial organization, quantitative marketing, and digitization. My research focuses on platform design, online reputation systems, and competition policy.

I am one of the organizers of the <a href="https://www.digitaleconomics-paris.fr/conference-2025">Paris Digital Economics Conference</a>, an annual event that brings together researchers on the economics of digital platforms and technology markets.
