During my Ph.D. at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, I had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for eight courses and a total of fifteen groups. For each group, I taught one class per week (1.5 hour) for twelve weeks and gave office hours according with the students' requests. I taught courses at various levels: Ph.D., Master, and Bachelor. Mainly, I worked with international students and all courses were taught in English.
